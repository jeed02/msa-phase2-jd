# MSA Phase 2 - Frontend

In the project directory, you can run:

# Genshin Impact Character Search

For this module, I decided to use a Genshin Impact API (Documentation [here](https://github.com/genshindev/api).)  
  
With this API, you can get the data of characters from the video game Genshin Impact. Using this data, I created a React Typescript web application that takes in user input (A characters name) and after clicking the search button, returns a card with the characters details on it. Below is an example of what the end product looks like:
